# wireshark
Wireshark is a widely used, open-source network protocol analyzer. It captures and analyzes network traffic, allowing users to inspect packets, troubleshoot network issues, and analyze protocols. Essentially, it acts as a "packet sniffer," intercepting network data and providing insights into what's happening on a network.
